## What and why is Not1MM

Not1MM's interface is a blantent ripoff of N1MM.
It is NOT N1MM and any problem you have with this software should in no way reflect on their software.

If you use Windows(tm) you should run their, or some other, program.

I personally don't. While it may be possible to get N1MM working under Wine, I haven't checked, I'd rather not have to jump thru the hoops.

**Currently this exists for my own personal amusement**.
Something to do in my free time.
While I'm not watching TV, Right vs Left political 'News' programs, mind numbing 'Reality' TV etc...

## What it is not

Working.

The current state is "**Not Working**". I literally just dragged some widgets out on a Qt Designer window, and wrote a couple stubs to display the interface. Next to nothing is working or useful.

## What it probably never will be

Feature complete.

## Running from source

Since this is packaged for PyPi, if you want to work on your own source branch, after cloning from github you would:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install setuptools
pip install build
source rebuild.sh
```

from the root directory. This installs a build chain and a local editable copy of not1mm.

There's two ways to launch the program from the local editable copy.

You can either be in the root of the source directory and type:

```bash
python not1mm
```

or be in some other directory and just type:

```bash
not1mm
```

## Various data file locations

### Data

If your system has an `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable set, the databases can be found there. Otherwise they will be found at `yourhome/.local/share/not1mm`

### Config

Configuration file(s) can be found at the location defined by `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Otherwise they will be found at `yourhome/.config/not1mm`

## Adding a database

On the initial running, a database is created for you called `ham.db`. This and all future databases are located in the data directory mentioned above. You can create new databases by selecting `File` > `New Database` from the main window. You can select previously created databases by selecting `File` > `Open Database`.

## Station Settings dialog

After initial run of the program or creating a new contact database you will need to fo to `File` > `Station Settings` and fill out the information in the dialog.

![settings screen](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/settings.png)

You can fill it out if you want to. You can leave our friends behind. 'Cause your friends don't fill, and if they don't fill. Well, they're no friends of yours.

You can fill. You can fill. Everyone look at your keys.

**I forgot my hat today**.

## Adding a contest

Select `File` > `New Contest`

![New Contest Dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/new_contest.png)

## Selecting an added contest as the current contest

Select `File` > `Open Contest`

![Open an existing contest](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/select_contest.png)

## Hiding screen elements

You can show or hide certain buttons/indicators by checking and unchecking their boxes under the view menu. You can then resize the screen to make it more compact.

![View Menu](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/view_menu.png)

The your choices will be remembered when you relaunch the program.

## Editing function key macros

You can edit the CW macros by right clicking on the buttons and filling out the dialog.
![Edit Macro](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/edit_macro.png)

## cty.dat and QRZ lookups for distance and bearing

When a callsign is entered, a look up is first done in a cty.dat file to determin the country of origin, geographic center, cq zone and ITU region. Great circle calculations are done to determin the heading and distance from your gridsquare to the grographic center. This information then displayed at the bottom left.

![snapshot of heading and distance](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/heading_distance.png)

After this, a request is made to QRZ for the gridsquare of the callsign. If there is a response the information is recalculated and displayed. You'll know is this has happened, since the gridsquare will replace the word "Regional".

![snapshot of heading and distance](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/heading_distance_qrz.png)

## Other uses for the call field

- [A Frequency] You can enter a frequency in kilohertz. This will change the band you're logging on. If you have CAT control, this will change the frequency of the radio as well.
- [CW, SSB, RTTY] You can set the mode logged. If you have CAT control this will also change the mode on the radio.
- [OPON] Change the operator currently logging.

**You must press the SPACE bar after entering any of the above.**

## Log Display

The Log display gets updated automatically when a contact is entered. The top half is a list of all contacts.

![Log Display Window](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/logdisplay.png)

The bottom half of the log displays contacts sorted by what's currently in the call entry field.

## Editing a contact

![Editing a cell](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/edit_cell.png)

You can double click a cell in the log window and edit its contents.

You can also Right-Click on a cell to bring up the edit dialog.

![right click edit dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm/raw/master/pic/edit_dialog.png)

You can not directly edit the multiplier status of a contact. Instead see the next section on recalculating mults. If you change the callsign make sure the `WPX` field is still valid.

## Recalulate Mults

After editing a contact and before generating a Cabrillo file. There is a Misc menu option that will recalculate the multipliers incase an edit had caused a change.

## Cabrillo

Kinda working in a forced way. Need to generalize it for multiple contests. Click on `File` > `Generate Cabrillo`

There's a few more fields I have to code in. But it's enough for me to edit and submit.

The file will be placed in your home directory. The name will be in the format of:

`StationCall`_`ContestName`.log

So for me it would be:

K6GTE_CQ-WPX-SSB.log

## ADIF

`File` > `Generate ADIF`

Boom... ADIF

`StationCall`_`ContestName`.adi

## Dupe checking

Added dupe checking. Big Red 'Dupe' will appear if it's a dupe...

## CAT

Added rudimentary check for running instance of flrig or rigctld. It will connect to whichever it finds first.
