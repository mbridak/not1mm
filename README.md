### The Elephant in the Room

Not1MM's interface is a blatant ripoff of N1MM. It is NOT N1MM and any problem
you have with this software should in no way reflect on their software.

### The What

Not1MM is, in my opinion, a usable amateur radio, or HAM, contest logger. It's
written in Python 3.10+, and uses Qt6 framework for the graphical interface
and SQLite for the database.

### Target Environment

The primary target for this application is Linux. It may be able to run on other
platforms, BSD and Windows. But I don't have a way, or desire, to directly support them.

I've recently purchased an M4 Mac Mini, So I'll probably put more effort into that platform as well.

### The Why

**Currently this exists for my own personal amusement**. I've recently retired
after 35+ years working for 'The Phone Company', GTE -> Verizon -> Frontier.
And being a Gentleman of Leisure, needed something to do in my free time.
I'm a casual contester and could not find any contesting software for Linux that
I wanted to use. There is [Tucnak](http://tucnak.nagano.cz/) which is very robust
and mature. It just wasn't for me.

## Code Maturity & Current Multi Multi Development Focus

Not1MM is, at times, fairly stable. Recently, it would seem that I'm desperately trying to change that. The current focus of development is adding support for Multi Multi contest operations. It is something that I have no practical experience in. So you can expect the same quality of code fit and finish.
